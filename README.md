# InteractiveGame.sln

This is an interactive game built in C# using the Windows Forms library. The game displays a red circle that the player can control with their mouse. The player's objective is to hit a target in the center of the screen, scoring points for each successful hit. The game gets progressively harder as the player scores more points, with the circle moving faster and the target becoming smaller.

## Installation

To install and run the game, you will need to have Visual Studio installed on your computer. Once you have cloned the repository, open the InteractiveGame.sln solution file in Visual Studio and build the solution. Then, click the "Start" button or press F5 to launch the game.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply click on the red circle and drag it towards the target in the center of the screen. When you release the mouse button, the circle will move towards the target at a speed determined by your score. If the circle collides with the target, you score a point and the speed increases. If the circle misses the target, you lose a point and the speed decreases.
